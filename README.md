# KD-Tree
**[K-Dimensional Tree](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/K-d_tree)**  
A K-Dimensional Tree (KD Tree) is a binary search tree in which each node represents a point in K-Dimensional space.  
This implementation only accounts for 2 dimensions, X and Y, but it is easily generalized to support more dimensions.
